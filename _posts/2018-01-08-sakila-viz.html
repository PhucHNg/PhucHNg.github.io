<h2>Visual Report of Sales of A Movie Rental Business</h2>
<div>
	<p>In this blog post, I created a dashboard summarizing sales of a fictitious, multi-national movie rental business during 2005-2006 period using Tableau. The dashboard provides a visual tool to answering and communicating questions such as Where are the biggest markets? How much are customers spending and on what movies or genres? Due to the fictitious nature of the data, my goal here is to practice integrating MySQL databases into Tableau, reporting data visually, and publishing dashboards to a website.</p>
</div>
<h3>Data</h3>
<div>
	<p>The data used is from MySQL's <a href="https://dev.mysql.com/doc/sakila/en/">Sakila Sample Database</a>. This is a fictitious database of rental history, customers, stores and movies of a movie rental business. Below is a schema of the database from www.jooq.org: </p>
	<br>
	<img class="img-fluid" src="https://www.jooq.org/img/sakila.png" alt="Sakila database schema">
	<br>
	<p>I installed the database on my local MySQL server following the <a href="https://dev.mysql.com/doc/sakila/en/sakila-installation.html">installation</a> directions. The database can be readily connected to Tableau using <b>Data > New Data Source > Connect To a Server > MySQL</b>. Since the variables I was interested in are stored across different tables, I created a <b>Custom SQL Query</b> to get a single table for this viz. </p>
	<pre><code class="language-sql">SELECT payment.*, 
	customer.first_name, customer.last_name, customer.active,
	address.address, city.city, country.country,
	category.name, film.title, film.release_year,
	film.rental_duration, film.rating, film.rental_rate
FROM payment 
INNER JOIN customer
    ON payment.customer_id = customer.customer_id
INNER JOIN address
    ON customer.address_id = address.address_id
INNER JOIN city
    ON address.city_id = city.city_id
INNER JOIN country
    ON city.country_id = country.country_id
INNER JOIN rental
    ON payment.rental_id = rental.rental_id
INNER JOIN inventory
    ON rental.inventory_id = inventory.inventory_id
RIGHT JOIN film
    ON inventory.film_id = film.film_id
INNER JOIN film_category
    ON film.film_id = film_category.film_id
INNER JOIN category
    ON film_category.category_id = category.category_id
WHERE customer.active = TRUE</code></pre>
</div>
<br>
<h3>Dashboard</h3>
<p>
	I was interested in viewing sales at different store locations and then looking into more detailed customer spending in the top ten countries. Tableau automatically generates latitudes and longitudes for mapping sales after I assigned Geographic Role to the country variable. This is showed in the Regions tab.
</p>
<p>
	I was also interested in sales trend over time, sales for different movie genres, and their daily rental rate (rental rate divided by rental duration). This is showed in the Genre tab. The last tab takes a closer look at top renting movies and customers. (The highest renting movie happens to be from the genre with the least total rental amount--Music.)

<div>
	<p>Though Sakila is a fictitious database, the data are not completely random. For instance, the biggest markets are countries with larger populations; movies with higher sales seem to have shorter rental durations and higher rates; and the reletively similar average customer spending in the top ten markets suggests that higher revenue is driven by larger number of customers.</p>
